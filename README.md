# Reddit Live Feed

Reddit posts, live, as they happen, right now, in your face!

I know I shouldn't keep starting projects before finishing others but they're all typically self-educational rather than useful tools for the public.

(Built as simply as possible, no yo react boilerplate junk)

## Install and Dev

	git clone https://github.com/entozoon/reddit-live-feed.git
